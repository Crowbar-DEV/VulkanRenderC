# VulkanRenderC
Trying to use vulkan with C, idk why, just bad at C++

# Docs
if interested, I made a little shell script to generate
documentation for vulkan functions and structures,
if you want to add documentation for a function or structure
just add it to neededApiCalls or neededApiStructs respectively
then run
```
bash gendocs.sh
```
documentation will be output to docs/functions docs/structs respectively
