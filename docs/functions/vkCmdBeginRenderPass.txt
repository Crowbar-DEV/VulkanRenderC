vkCmdBeginRenderPass - Begin a new render pass

C Specification
To begin a render pass instance, call:

void vkCmdBeginRenderPass(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    const VkRenderPassBeginInfo*                pRenderPassBegin,
    VkSubpassContents                           contents);
Parameters
commandBuffer is the command buffer in which to record the command.

pRenderPassBegin is a pointer to a VkRenderPassBeginInfo structure specifying the render pass to begin an instance of, and the framebuffer the instance uses.

contents is a VkSubpassContents value specifying how the commands in the first subpass will be provided.

Description
After beginning a render pass instance, the command buffer is ready to record the commands for the first subpass of that render pass.

VUID-vkCmdBeginRenderPass-initialLayout-00897
If any of the initialLayout or finalLayout member of the VkAttachmentDescription structures or the layout member of the VkAttachmentReference structures specified when creating the render pass specified in the renderPass member of pRenderPassBegin is VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL then the corresponding attachment image view of the framebuffer specified in the framebuffer member of pRenderPassBegin must have been created with a usage value including VK_IMAGE_USAGE_SAMPLED_BIT or VK_IMAGE_USAGE_INPUT_ATTACHMENT_BIT

VUID-vkCmdBeginRenderPass-initialLayout-00898
If any of the initialLayout or finalLayout member of the VkAttachmentDescription structures or the layout member of the VkAttachmentReference structures specified when creating the render pass specified in the renderPass member of pRenderPassBegin is VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_TRANSFER_SRC_OPTIMAL then the corresponding attachment image view of the framebuffer specified in the framebuffer member of pRenderPassBegin must have been created with a usage value including VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT

VUID-vkCmdBeginRenderPass-initialLayout-00899
If any of the initialLayout or finalLayout member of the VkAttachmentDescription structures or the layout member of the VkAttachmentReference structures specified when creating the render pass specified in the renderPass member of pRenderPassBegin is VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_TRANSFER_DST_OPTIMAL then the corresponding attachment image view of the framebuffer specified in the framebuffer member of pRenderPassBegin must have been created with a usage value including VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT

VUID-vkCmdBeginRenderPass-initialLayout-00900
If any of the initialLayout members of the VkAttachmentDescription structures specified when creating the render pass specified in the renderPass member of pRenderPassBegin is not VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED, then each such initialLayout must be equal to the current layout of the corresponding attachment image subresource of the framebuffer specified in the framebuffer member of pRenderPassBegin

VUID-vkCmdBeginRenderPass-srcStageMask-00901
The srcStageMask and dstStageMask members of any element of the pDependencies member of VkRenderPassCreateInfo used to create renderPass must be supported by the capabilities of the queue family identified by the queueFamilyIndex member of the VkCommandPoolCreateInfo used to create the command pool which commandBuffer was allocated from

VUID-vkCmdBeginRenderPass-framebuffer-02532
For any attachment in framebuffer that is used by renderPass and is bound to memory locations that are also bound to another attachment used by renderPass, and if at least one of those uses causes either attachment to be written to, both attachments must have had the VK_ATTACHMENT_DESCRIPTION_MAY_ALIAS_BIT set
