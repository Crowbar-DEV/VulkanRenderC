vkCmdSetViewport - Set the viewport on a command buffer

C Specification
If the bound pipeline state object was not created with the VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_VIEWPORT dynamic state enabled, viewport transformation parameters are specified using the pViewports member of VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo in the pipeline state object. If the pipeline state object was created with the VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_VIEWPORT dynamic state enabled, the viewport transformation parameters are dynamically set and changed with the command:

void vkCmdSetViewport(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    uint32_t                                    firstViewport,
    uint32_t                                    viewportCount,
    const VkViewport*                           pViewports);
Parameters
commandBuffer is the command buffer into which the command will be recorded.

firstViewport is the index of the first viewport whose parameters are updated by the command.

viewportCount is the number of viewports whose parameters are updated by the command.

pViewports is a pointer to an array of VkViewport structures specifying viewport parameters.

Description
The viewport parameters taken from element i of pViewports replace the current state for the viewport index firstViewport + i, for i in [0, viewportCount).

Valid Usage
VUID-vkCmdSetViewport-firstViewport-01222
firstViewport must be less than VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::maxViewports

VUID-vkCmdSetViewport-firstViewport-01223
The sum of firstViewport and viewportCount must be between 1 and VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::maxViewports, inclusive

VUID-vkCmdSetViewport-firstViewport-01224
If the multiple viewports feature is not enabled, firstViewport must be 0

VUID-vkCmdSetViewport-viewportCount-01225
If the multiple viewports feature is not enabled, viewportCount must be 1

Valid Usage (Implicit)
VUID-vkCmdSetViewport-commandBuffer-parameter
commandBuffer must be a valid VkCommandBuffer handle

VUID-vkCmdSetViewport-pViewports-parameter
pViewports must be a valid pointer to an array of viewportCount valid VkViewport structures

VUID-vkCmdSetViewport-commandBuffer-recording
commandBuffer must be in the recording state

VUID-vkCmdSetViewport-commandBuffer-cmdpool
The VkCommandPool that commandBuffer was allocated from must support graphics operations

VUID-vkCmdSetViewport-viewportCount-arraylength
viewportCount must be greater than 0

Host Synchronization
Host access to commandBuffer must be externally synchronized

Host access to the VkCommandPool that commandBuffer was allocated from must be externally synchronized
