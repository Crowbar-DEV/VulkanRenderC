VkResult vkCreateFence(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    const VkFenceCreateInfo*                    pCreateInfo,
    const VkAllocationCallbacks*                pAllocator,
    VkFence*                                    pFence);
Parameters
device is the logical device that creates the fence.

pCreateInfo is a pointer to a VkFenceCreateInfo structure containing information about how the fence is to be created.

pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the Memory Allocation chapter.

pFence is a pointer to a handle in which the resulting fence object is returned.
