vkDestroyFramebuffer - Destroy a framebuffer object

C Specification
To destroy a framebuffer, call:

void vkDestroyFramebuffer(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    VkFramebuffer                               framebuffer,
    const VkAllocationCallbacks*                pAllocator);
Parameters
device is the logical device that destroys the framebuffer.

framebuffer is the handle of the framebuffer to destroy.

pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the Memory Allocation chapter.

Description
Valid Usage
VUID-vkDestroyFramebuffer-framebuffer-00892
All submitted commands that refer to framebuffer must have completed execution

VUID-vkDestroyFramebuffer-framebuffer-00893
If VkAllocationCallbacks were provided when framebuffer was created, a compatible set of callbacks must be provided here

VUID-vkDestroyFramebuffer-framebuffer-00894
If no VkAllocationCallbacks were provided when framebuffer was created, pAllocator must be NULL

Valid Usage (Implicit)
VUID-vkDestroyFramebuffer-device-parameter
device must be a valid VkDevice handle

VUID-vkDestroyFramebuffer-framebuffer-parameter
If framebuffer is not VK_NULL_HANDLE, framebuffer must be a valid VkFramebuffer handle

VUID-vkDestroyFramebuffer-pAllocator-parameter
If pAllocator is not NULL, pAllocator must be a valid pointer to a valid VkAllocationCallbacks structure

VUID-vkDestroyFramebuffer-framebuffer-parent
If framebuffer is a valid handle, it must have been created, allocated, or retrieved from device

Host Synchronization
Host access to framebuffer must be externally synchronized
