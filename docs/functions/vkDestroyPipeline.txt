vkDestroyPipeline - Destroy a pipeline object

C Specification
To destroy a graphics or compute pipeline, call:

void vkDestroyPipeline(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    VkPipeline                                  pipeline,
    const VkAllocationCallbacks*                pAllocator);
Parameters
device is the logical device that destroys the pipeline.

pipeline is the handle of the pipeline to destroy.

pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the Memory Allocation chapter.

Description
Valid Usage
VUID-vkDestroyPipeline-pipeline-00765
All submitted commands that refer to pipeline must have completed execution

VUID-vkDestroyPipeline-pipeline-00766
If VkAllocationCallbacks were provided when pipeline was created, a compatible set of callbacks must be provided here

VUID-vkDestroyPipeline-pipeline-00767
If no VkAllocationCallbacks were provided when pipeline was created, pAllocator must be NULL

Valid Usage (Implicit)
VUID-vkDestroyPipeline-device-parameter
device must be a valid VkDevice handle

VUID-vkDestroyPipeline-pipeline-parameter
If pipeline is not VK_NULL_HANDLE, pipeline must be a valid VkPipeline handle

VUID-vkDestroyPipeline-pAllocator-parameter
If pAllocator is not NULL, pAllocator must be a valid pointer to a valid VkAllocationCallbacks structure

VUID-vkDestroyPipeline-pipeline-parent
If pipeline is a valid handle, it must have been created, allocated, or retrieved from device

Host Synchronization
Host access to pipeline must be externally synchronized
