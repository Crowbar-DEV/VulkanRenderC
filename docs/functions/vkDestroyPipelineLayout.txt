vkDestroyPipelineLayout - Destroy a pipeline layout object

C Specification
To destroy a pipeline layout, call:

void vkDestroyPipelineLayout(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    VkPipelineLayout                            pipelineLayout,
    const VkAllocationCallbacks*                pAllocator);
Parameters
device is the logical device that destroys the pipeline layout.

pipelineLayout is the pipeline layout to destroy.

pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the Memory Allocation chapter.

Description
Valid Usage
VUID-vkDestroyPipelineLayout-pipelineLayout-00299
If VkAllocationCallbacks were provided when pipelineLayout was created, a compatible set of callbacks must be provided here

VUID-vkDestroyPipelineLayout-pipelineLayout-00300
If no VkAllocationCallbacks were provided when pipelineLayout was created, pAllocator must be NULL

VUID-vkDestroyPipelineLayout-pipelineLayout-02004
pipelineLayout must not have been passed to any vkCmd* command for any command buffers that are still in the recording state when vkDestroyPipelineLayout is called

Valid Usage (Implicit)
VUID-vkDestroyPipelineLayout-device-parameter
device must be a valid VkDevice handle

VUID-vkDestroyPipelineLayout-pipelineLayout-parameter
If pipelineLayout is not VK_NULL_HANDLE, pipelineLayout must be a valid VkPipelineLayout handle

VUID-vkDestroyPipelineLayout-pAllocator-parameter
If pAllocator is not NULL, pAllocator must be a valid pointer to a valid VkAllocationCallbacks structure

VUID-vkDestroyPipelineLayout-pipelineLayout-parent
If pipelineLayout is a valid handle, it must have been created, allocated, or retrieved from device

Host Synchronization
