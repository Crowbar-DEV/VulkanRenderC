C Specification
To destroy a semaphore, call:

void vkDestroySemaphore(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    VkSemaphore                                 semaphore,
    const VkAllocationCallbacks*                pAllocator);
Parameters
device is the logical device that destroys the semaphore.

semaphore is the handle of the semaphore to destroy.

pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the Memory Allocation chapter.

Description
Valid Usage
VUID-vkDestroySemaphore-semaphore-01137
All submitted batches that refer to semaphore must have completed execution

VUID-vkDestroySemaphore-semaphore-01138
If VkAllocationCallbacks were provided when semaphore was created, a compatible set of callbacks must be provided here

VUID-vkDestroySemaphore-semaphore-01139
If no VkAllocationCallbacks were provided when semaphore was created, pAllocator must be NULL

Valid Usage (Implicit)
VUID-vkDestroySemaphore-device-parameter
device must be a valid VkDevice handle

VUID-vkDestroySemaphore-semaphore-parameter
If semaphore is not VK_NULL_HANDLE, semaphore must be a valid VkSemaphore handle

VUID-vkDestroySemaphore-pAllocator-parameter
If pAllocator is not NULL, pAllocator must be a valid pointer to a valid VkAllocationCallbacks structure

VUID-vkDestroySemaphore-semaphore-parent
If semaphore is a valid handle, it must have been created, allocated, or retrieved from device
