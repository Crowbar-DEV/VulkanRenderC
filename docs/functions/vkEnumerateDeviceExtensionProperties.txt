vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties - Returns properties of available physical device extensions

C Specification
To query the extensions available to a given physical device, call:

VkResult vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties(
    VkPhysicalDevice                            physicalDevice,
    const char*                                 pLayerName,
    uint32_t*                                   pPropertyCount,
    VkExtensionProperties*                      pProperties);
Parameters
physicalDevice is the physical device that will be queried.

pLayerName is either NULL or a pointer to a null-terminated UTF-8 string naming the layer to retrieve extensions from.

pPropertyCount is a pointer to an integer related to the number of extension properties available or queried, and is treated in the same fashion as the vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties::pPropertyCount parameter.

pProperties is either NULL or a pointer to an array of VkExtensionProperties structures.

Description
When pLayerName parameter is NULL, only extensions provided by the Vulkan implementation or by implicitly enabled layers are returned. When pLayerName is the name of a layer, the device extensions provided by that layer are returned.

Implementations must not advertise any pair of extensions that cannot be enabled together due to behavioral differences, or any extension that cannot be enabled against the advertised version.

Valid Usage (Implicit)
VUID-vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties-physicalDevice-parameter
physicalDevice must be a valid VkPhysicalDevice handle

VUID-vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties-pLayerName-parameter
If pLayerName is not NULL, pLayerName must be a null-terminated UTF-8 string

VUID-vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties-pPropertyCount-parameter
pPropertyCount must be a valid pointer to a uint32_t value

VUID-vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties-pProperties-parameter
If the value referenced by pPropertyCount is not 0, and pProperties is not NULL, pProperties must be a valid pointer to an array of pPropertyCount VkExtensionProperties structures

Return Codes
Success
VK_SUCCESS

VK_INCOMPLETE

Failure
VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY

VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY

VK_ERROR_LAYER_NOT_PRESENT
