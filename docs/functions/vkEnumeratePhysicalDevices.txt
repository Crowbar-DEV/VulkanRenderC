vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices - Enumerates the physical devices accessible to a Vulkan instance

C Specification
To retrieve a list of physical device objects representing the physical devices installed in the system, call:

VkResult vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(
    VkInstance                                  instance,
    uint32_t*                                   pPhysicalDeviceCount,
    VkPhysicalDevice*                           pPhysicalDevices);
Parameters
instance is a handle to a Vulkan instance previously created with vkCreateInstance.

pPhysicalDeviceCount is a pointer to an integer related to the number of physical devices available or queried, as described below.

pPhysicalDevices is either NULL or a pointer to an array of VkPhysicalDevice handles.

Description
If pPhysicalDevices is NULL, then the number of physical devices available is returned in pPhysicalDeviceCount. Otherwise, pPhysicalDeviceCount must point to a variable set by the user to the number of elements in the pPhysicalDevices array, and on return the variable is overwritten with the number of handles actually written to pPhysicalDevices. If pPhysicalDeviceCount is less than the number of physical devices available, at most pPhysicalDeviceCount structures will be written. If pPhysicalDeviceCount is smaller than the number of physical devices available, VK_INCOMPLETE will be returned instead of VK_SUCCESS, to indicate that not all the available physical devices were returned.

Valid Usage (Implicit)
VUID-vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices-instance-parameter
instance must be a valid VkInstance handle

VUID-vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices-pPhysicalDeviceCount-parameter
pPhysicalDeviceCount must be a valid pointer to a uint32_t value

VUID-vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices-pPhysicalDevices-parameter
If the value referenced by pPhysicalDeviceCount is not 0, and pPhysicalDevices is not NULL, pPhysicalDevices must be a valid pointer to an array of pPhysicalDeviceCount VkPhysicalDevice handles

Return Codes
Success
VK_SUCCESS

VK_INCOMPLETE

Failure
VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY

VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY

VK_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED
