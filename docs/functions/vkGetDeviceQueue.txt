vkGetDeviceQueue - Get a queue handle from a device

C Specification
To retrieve a handle to a VkQueue object, call:

void vkGetDeviceQueue(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    uint32_t                                    queueFamilyIndex,
    uint32_t                                    queueIndex,
    VkQueue*                                    pQueue);
Parameters
device is the logical device that owns the queue.

queueFamilyIndex is the index of the queue family to which the queue belongs.

queueIndex is the index within this queue family of the queue to retrieve.

pQueue is a pointer to a VkQueue object that will be filled with the handle for the requested queue.

Description
vkGetDeviceQueue must only be used to get queues that were created with the flags parameter of VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo set to zero. To get queues that were created with a non-zero flags parameter use vkGetDeviceQueue2.

Valid Usage
VUID-vkGetDeviceQueue-queueFamilyIndex-00384
queueFamilyIndex must be one of the queue family indices specified when device was created, via the VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo structure

VUID-vkGetDeviceQueue-queueIndex-00385
queueIndex must be less than the number of queues created for the specified queue family index when device was created, via the queueCount member of the VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo structure

VUID-vkGetDeviceQueue-flags-01841
VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo::flags must have been set to zero when device was created

Valid Usage (Implicit)
VUID-vkGetDeviceQueue-device-parameter
device must be a valid VkDevice handle

VUID-vkGetDeviceQueue-pQueue-parameter
pQueue must be a valid pointer to a VkQueue handle
