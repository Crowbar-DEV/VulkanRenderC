vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR - Query surface capabilities

C Specification
To query the basic capabilities of a surface, needed in order to create a swapchain, call:

VkResult vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR(
    VkPhysicalDevice                            physicalDevice,
    VkSurfaceKHR                                surface,
    VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR*                   pSurfaceCapabilities);
Parameters
physicalDevice is the physical device that will be associated with the swapchain to be created, as described for vkCreateSwapchainKHR.

surface is the surface that will be associated with the swapchain.

pSurfaceCapabilities is a pointer to a VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR structure in which the capabilities are returned.

Description
Valid Usage (Implicit)
VUID-vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR-physicalDevice-parameter
physicalDevice must be a valid VkPhysicalDevice handle

VUID-vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR-surface-parameter
surface must be a valid VkSurfaceKHR handle

VUID-vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR-pSurfaceCapabilities-parameter
pSurfaceCapabilities must be a valid pointer to a VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR structure

VUID-vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR-commonparent
Both of physicalDevice, and surface must have been created, allocated, or retrieved from the same VkInstance

Return Codes
Success
VK_SUCCESS

Failure
VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY

VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY

VK_ERROR_SURFACE_LOST_KHR
