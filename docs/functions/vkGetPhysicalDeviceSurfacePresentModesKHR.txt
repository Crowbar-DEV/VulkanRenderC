vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR - Query supported presentation modes

C Specification
To query the supported presentation modes for a surface, call:

VkResult vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR(
    VkPhysicalDevice                            physicalDevice,
    VkSurfaceKHR                                surface,
    uint32_t*                                   pPresentModeCount,
    VkPresentModeKHR*                           pPresentModes);
Parameters
physicalDevice is the physical device that will be associated with the swapchain to be created, as described for vkCreateSwapchainKHR.

surface is the surface that will be associated with the swapchain.

pPresentModeCount is a pointer to an integer related to the number of presentation modes available or queried, as described below.

pPresentModes is either NULL or a pointer to an array of VkPresentModeKHR values, indicating the supported presentation modes.

Description
If pPresentModes is NULL, then the number of presentation modes supported for the given surface is returned in pPresentModeCount. Otherwise, pPresentModeCount must point to a variable set by the user to the number of elements in the pPresentModes array, and on return the variable is overwritten with the number of values actually written to pPresentModes. If the value of pPresentModeCount is less than the number of presentation modes supported, at most pPresentModeCount values will be written. If pPresentModeCount is smaller than the number of presentation modes supported for the given surface, VK_INCOMPLETE will be returned instead of VK_SUCCESS to indicate that not all the available values were returned.

Valid Usage (Implicit)
VUID-vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR-physicalDevice-parameter
physicalDevice must be a valid VkPhysicalDevice handle

VUID-vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR-surface-parameter
surface must be a valid VkSurfaceKHR handle

VUID-vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR-pPresentModeCount-parameter
pPresentModeCount must be a valid pointer to a uint32_t value

VUID-vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR-pPresentModes-parameter
If the value referenced by pPresentModeCount is not 0, and pPresentModes is not NULL, pPresentModes must be a valid pointer to an array of pPresentModeCount VkPresentModeKHR values

VUID-vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR-commonparent
Both of physicalDevice, and surface must have been created, allocated, or retrieved from the same VkInstance

Return Codes
Success
VK_SUCCESS

VK_INCOMPLETE

Failure
VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY

VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY
