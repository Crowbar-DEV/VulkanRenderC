vkGetSwapchainImagesKHR - Obtain the array of presentable images associated with a swapchain

C Specification
To obtain the array of presentable images associated with a swapchain, call:

VkResult vkGetSwapchainImagesKHR(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    VkSwapchainKHR                              swapchain,
    uint32_t*                                   pSwapchainImageCount,
    VkImage*                                    pSwapchainImages);
Parameters
device is the device associated with swapchain.

swapchain is the swapchain to query.

pSwapchainImageCount is a pointer to an integer related to the number of presentable images available or queried, as described below.

pSwapchainImages is either NULL or a pointer to an array of VkImage handles.

Description
If pSwapchainImages is NULL, then the number of presentable images for swapchain is returned in pSwapchainImageCount. Otherwise, pSwapchainImageCount must point to a variable set by the user to the number of elements in the pSwapchainImages array, and on return the variable is overwritten with the number of structures actually written to pSwapchainImages. If the value of pSwapchainImageCount is less than the number of presentable images for swapchain, at most pSwapchainImageCount structures will be written. If pSwapchainImageCount is smaller than the number of presentable images for swapchain, VK_INCOMPLETE will be returned instead of VK_SUCCESS to indicate that not all the available values were returned.

Valid Usage (Implicit)
VUID-vkGetSwapchainImagesKHR-device-parameter
device must be a valid VkDevice handle

VUID-vkGetSwapchainImagesKHR-swapchain-parameter
swapchain must be a valid VkSwapchainKHR handle

VUID-vkGetSwapchainImagesKHR-pSwapchainImageCount-parameter
pSwapchainImageCount must be a valid pointer to a uint32_t value

VUID-vkGetSwapchainImagesKHR-pSwapchainImages-parameter
If the value referenced by pSwapchainImageCount is not 0, and pSwapchainImages is not NULL, pSwapchainImages must be a valid pointer to an array of pSwapchainImageCount VkImage handles

VUID-vkGetSwapchainImagesKHR-commonparent
Both of device, and swapchain must have been created, allocated, or retrieved from the same VkInstance

Return Codes
Success
VK_SUCCESS

VK_INCOMPLETE

Failure
VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY

VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY
