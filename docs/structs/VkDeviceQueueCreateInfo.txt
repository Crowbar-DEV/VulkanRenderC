VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created device queue

C Specification
The VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo structure is defined as:

typedef struct VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo {
    VkStructureType             sType;
    const void*                 pNext;
    VkDeviceQueueCreateFlags    flags;
    uint32_t                    queueFamilyIndex;
    uint32_t                    queueCount;
    const float*                pQueuePriorities;
} VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo;
Members
sType is the type of this structure.

pNext is NULL or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.

flags is a bitmask indicating behavior of the queue.

queueFamilyIndex is an unsigned integer indicating the index of the queue family to create on this device. This index corresponds to the index of an element of the pQueueFamilyProperties array that was returned by vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties.

queueCount is an unsigned integer specifying the number of queues to create in the queue family indicated by queueFamilyIndex.

pQueuePriorities is a pointer to an array of queueCount normalized floating point values, specifying priorities of work that will be submitted to each created queue. See Queue Priority for more information.

Description
Valid Usage
VUID-VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo-queueFamilyIndex-00381
queueFamilyIndex must be less than pQueueFamilyPropertyCount returned by vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties

VUID-VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo-queueCount-00382
queueCount must be less than or equal to the queueCount member of the VkQueueFamilyProperties structure, as returned by vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties in the pQueueFamilyProperties[queueFamilyIndex]

VUID-VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo-pQueuePriorities-00383
Each element of pQueuePriorities must be between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive

VUID-VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo-flags-02861
If the protected memory feature is not enabled, the VK_DEVICE_QUEUE_CREATE_PROTECTED_BIT bit of flags must not be set.

Valid Usage (Implicit)
VUID-VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo-sType-sType
sType must be VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_DEVICE_QUEUE_CREATE_INFO

VUID-VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo-pNext-pNext
pNext must be NULL or a pointer to a valid instance of VkDeviceQueueGlobalPriorityCreateInfoEXT

VUID-VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo-sType-unique
The sType value of each struct in the pNext chain must be unique

VUID-VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo-flags-parameter
flags must be a valid combination of VkDeviceQueueCreateFlagBits values

VUID-VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo-pQueuePriorities-parameter
pQueuePriorities must be a valid pointer to an array of queueCount float values

VUID-VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo-queueCount-arraylength
queueCount must be greater than 0
