VkFenceCreateInfo - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created fence

C Specification
The VkFenceCreateInfo structure is defined as:

typedef struct VkFenceCreateInfo {
    VkStructureType       sType;
    const void*           pNext;
    VkFenceCreateFlags    flags;
} VkFenceCreateInfo;
Members
sType is the type of this structure.

pNext is NULL or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.

flags is a bitmask of VkFenceCreateFlagBits specifying the initial state and behavior of the fence.

Description
Valid Usage (Implicit)
VUID-VkFenceCreateInfo-sType-sType
sType must be VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_FENCE_CREATE_INFO

VUID-VkFenceCreateInfo-pNext-pNext
Each pNext member of any structure (including this one) in the pNext chain must be either NULL or a pointer to a valid instance of VkExportFenceCreateInfo or VkExportFenceWin32HandleInfoKHR

VUID-VkFenceCreateInfo-sType-unique
The sType value of each struct in the pNext chain must be unique

VUID-VkFenceCreateInfo-flags-parameter
flags must be a valid combination of VkFenceCreateFlagBits values
