Members
sType is the type of this structure.

pNext is NULL or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.

flags is a bitmask of VkPipelineCreateFlagBits specifying how the pipeline will be generated.

stageCount is the number of entries in the pStages array.

pStages is a pointer to an array of stageCount VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo structures describing the set of the shader stages to be included in the graphics pipeline.

pVertexInputState is a pointer to a VkPipelineVertexInputStateCreateInfo structure. It is ignored if the pipeline includes a mesh shader stage.

pInputAssemblyState is a pointer to a VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo structure which determines input assembly behavior, as described in Drawing Commands. It is ignored if the pipeline includes a mesh shader stage.

pTessellationState is a pointer to a VkPipelineTessellationStateCreateInfo structure, and is ignored if the pipeline does not include a tessellation control shader stage and tessellation evaluation shader stage.

pViewportState is a pointer to a VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo structure, and is ignored if the pipeline has rasterization disabled.

pRasterizationState is a pointer to a VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo structure.

pMultisampleState is a pointer to a VkPipelineMultisampleStateCreateInfo structure, and is ignored if the pipeline has rasterization disabled.

pDepthStencilState is a pointer to a VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo structure, and is ignored if the pipeline has rasterization disabled or if the subpass of the render pass the pipeline is created against does not use a depth/stencil attachment.

pColorBlendState is a pointer to a VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo structure, and is ignored if the pipeline has rasterization disabled or if the subpass of the render pass the pipeline is created against does not use any color attachments.

pDynamicState is a pointer to a VkPipelineDynamicStateCreateInfo structure, and is used to indicate which properties of the pipeline state object are dynamic and can be changed independently of the pipeline state. This can be NULL, which means no state in the pipeline is considered dynamic.

layout is the description of binding locations used by both the pipeline and descriptor sets used with the pipeline.

renderPass is a handle to a render pass object describing the environment in which the pipeline will be used; the pipeline must only be used with an instance of any render pass compatible with the one provided. See Render Pass Compatibility for more information.

subpass is the index of the subpass in the render pass where this pipeline will be used.

basePipelineHandle is a pipeline to derive from.

basePipelineIndex is an index into the pCreateInfos parameter to use as a pipeline to derive from.

Description
The parameters basePipelineHandle and basePipelineIndex are described in more detail in Pipeline Derivatives.

If any shader stage fails to compile, the compile log will be reported back to the application, and VK_ERROR_INVALID_SHADER_NV will be generated.
