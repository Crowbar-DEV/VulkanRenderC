VkInstance - Opaque handle to an instance object

C Specification
There is no global state in Vulkan and all per-application state is stored in a VkInstance object. Creating a VkInstance object initializes the Vulkan library and allows the application to pass information about itself to the implementation.

Instances are represented by VkInstance handles:

VK_DEFINE_HANDLE(VkInstance)
