VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created pipeline color blend state

C Specification
The VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo structure is defined as:

typedef struct VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo {
    VkStructureType                               sType;
    const void*                                   pNext;
    VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateFlags          flags;
    VkBool32                                      logicOpEnable;
    VkLogicOp                                     logicOp;
    uint32_t                                      attachmentCount;
    const VkPipelineColorBlendAttachmentState*    pAttachments;
    float                                         blendConstants[4];
} VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo;
Members
sType is the type of this structure.

pNext is NULL or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.

flags is reserved for future use.

logicOpEnable controls whether to apply Logical Operations.

logicOp selects which logical operation to apply.

attachmentCount is the number of VkPipelineColorBlendAttachmentState elements in pAttachments. This value must equal the colorAttachmentCount for the subpass in which this pipeline is used.

pAttachments: is a pointer to an array of per target attachment states.

blendConstants is a pointer to an array of four values used as the R, G, B, and A components of the blend constant that are used in blending, depending on the blend factor.

Description
Each element of the pAttachments array is a VkPipelineColorBlendAttachmentState structure specifying per-target blending state for each individual color attachment. If the independent blending feature is not enabled on the device, all VkPipelineColorBlendAttachmentState elements in the pAttachments array must be identical.

Valid Usage
VUID-VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo-pAttachments-00605
If the independent blending feature is not enabled, all elements of pAttachments must be identical

VUID-VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo-logicOpEnable-00606
If the logic operations feature is not enabled, logicOpEnable must be VK_FALSE

VUID-VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo-logicOpEnable-00607
If logicOpEnable is VK_TRUE, logicOp must be a valid VkLogicOp value

Valid Usage (Implicit)
VUID-VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo-sType-sType
sType must be VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PIPELINE_COLOR_BLEND_STATE_CREATE_INFO

VUID-VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo-pNext-pNext
pNext must be NULL or a pointer to a valid instance of VkPipelineColorBlendAdvancedStateCreateInfoEXT

VUID-VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo-sType-unique
The sType value of each struct in the pNext chain must be unique

VUID-VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo-flags-zerobitmask
flags must be 0

VUID-VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo-pAttachments-parameter
If attachmentCount is not 0, pAttachments must be a valid pointer to an array of attachmentCount valid VkPipelineColorBlendAttachmentState structures
