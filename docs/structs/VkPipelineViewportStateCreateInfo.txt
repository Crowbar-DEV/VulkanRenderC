VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created pipeline viewport state

C Specification
The VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo structure is defined as:

typedef struct VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo {
    VkStructureType                       sType;
    const void*                           pNext;
    VkPipelineViewportStateCreateFlags    flags;
    uint32_t                              viewportCount;
    const VkViewport*                     pViewports;
    uint32_t                              scissorCount;
    const VkRect2D*                       pScissors;
} VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo;
Members
sType is the type of this structure.

pNext is NULL or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.

flags is reserved for future use.

viewportCount is the number of viewports used by the pipeline.

pViewports is a pointer to an array of VkViewport structures, defining the viewport transforms. If the viewport state is dynamic, this member is ignored.

scissorCount is the number of scissors and must match the number of viewports.

pScissors is a pointer to an array of VkRect2D structures defining the rectangular bounds of the scissor for the corresponding viewport. If the scissor state is dynamic, this member is ignored.

Description
Valid Usage
VUID-VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo-viewportCount-01216
If the multiple viewports feature is not enabled, viewportCount must be 1

VUID-VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo-scissorCount-01217
If the multiple viewports feature is not enabled, scissorCount must be 1

VUID-VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo-viewportCount-01218
viewportCount must be between 1 and VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::maxViewports, inclusive

VUID-VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo-scissorCount-01219
scissorCount must be between 1 and VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::maxViewports, inclusive

VUID-VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo-scissorCount-01220
scissorCount and viewportCount must be identical

VUID-VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo-x-02821
The x and y members of offset member of any element of pScissors must be greater than or equal to 0

VUID-VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo-offset-02822
Evaluation of (offset.x + extent.width) must not cause a signed integer addition overflow for any element of pScissors

VUID-VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo-offset-02823
Evaluation of (offset.y + extent.height) must not cause a signed integer addition overflow for any element of pScissors

VUID-VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo-viewportWScalingEnable-01726
If the viewportWScalingEnable member of a VkPipelineViewportWScalingStateCreateInfoNV structure included in the pNext chain is VK_TRUE, the viewportCount member of the VkPipelineViewportWScalingStateCreateInfoNV structure must be equal to viewportCount

Valid Usage (Implicit)
VUID-VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo-sType-sType
sType must be VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PIPELINE_VIEWPORT_STATE_CREATE_INFO

VUID-VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo-pNext-pNext
Each pNext member of any structure (including this one) in the pNext chain must be either NULL or a pointer to a valid instance of VkPipelineViewportCoarseSampleOrderStateCreateInfoNV, VkPipelineViewportExclusiveScissorStateCreateInfoNV, VkPipelineViewportShadingRateImageStateCreateInfoNV, VkPipelineViewportSwizzleStateCreateInfoNV, or VkPipelineViewportWScalingStateCreateInfoNV

VUID-VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo-sType-unique
The sType value of each struct in the pNext chain must be unique

VUID-VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo-flags-zerobitmask
flags must be 0

VUID-VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo-viewportCount-arraylength
viewportCount must be greater than 0

VUID-VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo-scissorCount-arraylength
scissorCount must be greater than 0
