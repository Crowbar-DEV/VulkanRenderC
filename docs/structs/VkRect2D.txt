VkRect2D - Structure specifying a two-dimensional subregion

C Specification
Rectangles are used to describe a specified rectangular region of pixels within an image or framebuffer. Rectangles include both an offset and an extent of the same dimensionality, as described above. Two-dimensional rectangles are defined by the structure

typedef struct VkRect2D {
    VkOffset2D    offset;
    VkExtent2D    extent;
} VkRect2D;
Members
offset is a VkOffset2D specifying the rectangle offset.

extent is a VkExtent2D specifying the rectangle extent.
