VkRenderPassBeginInfo - Structure specifying render pass begin info

C Specification
The VkRenderPassBeginInfo structure is defined as:

typedef struct VkRenderPassBeginInfo {
    VkStructureType        sType;
    const void*            pNext;
    VkRenderPass           renderPass;
    VkFramebuffer          framebuffer;
    VkRect2D               renderArea;
    uint32_t               clearValueCount;
    const VkClearValue*    pClearValues;
} VkRenderPassBeginInfo;
Members
sType is the type of this structure.

pNext is NULL or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.

renderPass is the render pass to begin an instance of.

framebuffer is the framebuffer containing the attachments that are used with the render pass.

renderArea is the render area that is affected by the render pass instance, and is described in more detail below.

clearValueCount is the number of elements in pClearValues.

pClearValues is a pointer to an array of clearValueCount VkClearValue structures that contains clear values for each attachment, if the attachment uses a loadOp value of VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_CLEAR or if the attachment has a depth/stencil format and uses a stencilLoadOp value of VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_CLEAR. The array is indexed by attachment number. Only elements corresponding to cleared attachments are used. Other elements of pClearValues are ignored.

Description
renderArea is the render area that is affected by the render pass instance. The effects of attachment load, store and multisample resolve operations are restricted to the pixels whose x and y coordinates fall within the render area on all attachments. The render area extends to all layers of framebuffer. The application must ensure (using scissor if necessary) that all rendering is contained within the render area.

When multiview is enabled, the resolve operation at the end of a subpass applies to all views in the view mask.

Note
There may be a performance cost for using a render area smaller than the framebuffer, unless it matches the render area granularity for the render pass.
