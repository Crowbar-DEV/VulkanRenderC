VkRenderPassCreateInfo - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created render pass

C Specification
The VkRenderPassCreateInfo structure is defined as:

typedef struct VkRenderPassCreateInfo {
    VkStructureType                   sType;
    const void*                       pNext;
    VkRenderPassCreateFlags           flags;
    uint32_t                          attachmentCount;
    const VkAttachmentDescription*    pAttachments;
    uint32_t                          subpassCount;
    const VkSubpassDescription*       pSubpasses;
    uint32_t                          dependencyCount;
    const VkSubpassDependency*        pDependencies;
} VkRenderPassCreateInfo;
Members
sType is the type of this structure.

pNext is NULL or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.

flags is reserved for future use.

attachmentCount is the number of attachments used by this render pass.

pAttachments is a pointer to an array of attachmentCount VkAttachmentDescription structures describing the attachments used by the render pass.

subpassCount is the number of subpasses to create.

pSubpasses is a pointer to an array of subpassCount VkSubpassDescription structures describing each subpass.

dependencyCount is the number of memory dependencies between pairs of subpasses.

pDependencies is a pointer to an array of dependencyCount VkSubpassDependency structures describing dependencies between pairs of subpasses.

Description
Note
Care should be taken to avoid a data race here; if any subpasses access attachments with overlapping memory locations, and one of those accesses is a write, a subpass dependency needs to be included between them.

Valid Usage

VUID-VkRenderPassCreateInfo-pNext-02512
If the pNext chain includes a VkRenderPassMultiviewCreateInfo structure, for any element of pDependencies with a dependencyFlags member that does not include VK_DEPENDENCY_VIEW_LOCAL_BIT, the corresponding element of the pViewOffsets member of that VkRenderPassMultiviewCreateInfo instance must be 0

VUID-VkRenderPassCreateInfo-pNext-02513
If the pNext chain includes a VkRenderPassMultiviewCreateInfo structure, elements of its pViewMasks member must either all be 0, or all not be 0

VUID-VkRenderPassCreateInfo-pNext-02514
If the pNext chain includes a VkRenderPassMultiviewCreateInfo structure, and each element of its pViewMasks member is 0, the dependencyFlags member of each element of pDependencies must not include VK_DEPENDENCY_VIEW_LOCAL_BIT

VUID-VkRenderPassCreateInfo-pNext-02515
If the pNext chain includes a VkRenderPassMultiviewCreateInfo structure, and each element of its pViewMasks member is 0, correlatedViewMaskCount must be 0

VUID-VkRenderPassCreateInfo-pNext-02516
If the pNext chain includes a VkRenderPassMultiviewCreateInfo structure, each element of its pViewMask member must not have a bit set at an index greater than or equal to VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::maxFramebufferLayers

VUID-VkRenderPassCreateInfo-pDependencies-00837
For any element of pDependencies, if the srcSubpass is not VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL, all stage flags included in the srcStageMask member of that dependency must be a pipeline stage supported by the pipeline identified by the pipelineBindPoint member of the source subpass

VUID-VkRenderPassCreateInfo-pDependencies-00838
