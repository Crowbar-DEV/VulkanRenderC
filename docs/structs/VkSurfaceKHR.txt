VkSurfaceKHR - Opaque handle to a surface object

C Specification
Native platform surface or window objects are abstracted by surface objects, which are represented by VkSurfaceKHR handles:

VK_DEFINE_NON_DISPATCHABLE_HANDLE(VkSurfaceKHR)
Description
The VK_KHR_surface extension declares the VkSurfaceKHR object, and provides a function for destroying VkSurfaceKHR objects. Separate platform-specific extensions each provide a function for creating a VkSurfaceKHR object for the respective platform. From the applicationâ€™s perspective this is an opaque handle, just like the handles of other Vulkan objects.

Note
On certain platforms, the Vulkan loader and ICDs may have conventions that treat the handle as a pointer to a structure containing the platform-specific information about the surface. This will be described in the documentation for the loader-ICD interface, and in the vk_icd.h header file of the LoaderAndTools source-code repository. This does not affect the loader-layer interface; layers may wrap VkSurfaceKHR objects.
