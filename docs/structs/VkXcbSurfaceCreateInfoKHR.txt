VkXcbSurfaceCreateInfoKHR - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created Xcb surface object

C Specification
The VkXcbSurfaceCreateInfoKHR structure is defined as:

typedef struct VkXcbSurfaceCreateInfoKHR {
    VkStructureType               sType;
    const void*                   pNext;
    VkXcbSurfaceCreateFlagsKHR    flags;
    xcb_connection_t*             connection;
    xcb_window_t                  window;
} VkXcbSurfaceCreateInfoKHR;
Members
sType is the type of this structure.

pNext is NULL or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.

flags is reserved for future use.

connection is a pointer to an xcb_connection_t to the X server.

window is the xcb_window_t for the X11 window to associate the surface with.
